*flexoki-py* is a Python library that provides easy access to [Flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki), an "inky color scheme for prose and code".

The intent behind this package is to make the colors from Flexoki accessible to other Python packages centered around graphics, especially [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).

Key features:

- Access to full library of Flexoki 2.0 colors
- Shortcuts to collections of colors (referred to as "Palettes")
- Robust filtering of colors based on hue and lightness
- Ability to register colors and palettes with matplotlib (as named colors and colormaps, respectively)
